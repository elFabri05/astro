    "profile": "Born in Argentina with a fervent desire for adventure, I spent my twenties traveling across South America and Europe. My pursuits included climbing mountains, skiing down their slopes, and flying over breathtaking landscapes. However, these adventures were more than just physical exploits; they were a quest for meaning. I carried with me a deep curiosity for culture, languages, philosophy, and religion.\nFour years ago, I was introduced to Astrology. Captivated by its symbols and energies, I delved deeply into its mysteries, becoming thoroughly immersed. This journey revealed profound insights and hidden values, allowing me to see life with newfound clarity.\nJoin me on this never ending evolutionary journey."
